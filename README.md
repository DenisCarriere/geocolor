*style geojson based on data classifications*


This module uses [turf](https://github.com/morganherlocker/turf) to classify data contained in geojson properties, and assign color values based on the [simplestyle-spec](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec/blob/master/1.1.0/README.md). This means that when your geojson is rendered in github, gists, mapbox, or other simplestyle-spec compliant renderers, you will get nice styles that help to visualize what's what in your data.
